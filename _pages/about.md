I am an assistant professor at [Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST)](https://www.naist.jp/), a member of [Social Computing Lab](https://sociocom.naist.jp/). I received my Ph.D degree in social informatics at [Kyoto University](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/), supervised by Sugiyama Kazunari. My research interests span data mining and information retrieval.
