I am an assistant professor at [nara institute of science and technology (NAIST)](https://www.naist.jp/), a member of [social computing lab](https://sociocom.naist.jp/). I received my Ph.D degree in social informatics at [Kyoto University](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/), supervised by Sugiyama Kazunari. My research interests span data mining and information retrieval.
